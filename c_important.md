# C important notes
- Why C is a middle level Language(system level features)
	- Allows direct access to memory using pointers
	- Allows bit manipulation using bitwise operators
	- Assembly language can be written within C code
- C allows procedural programming
- Popular choice for system level apps
- Has a wide variety of built in functions eg printf, scanf and headers like stdio.h, limits.h, math.h, time.h etc

# Preprocessing
- Used to:
	- include header files i.e #include
	- define macros i.e #define
	- perform conditional compilation i.e #ifdef and #endif

# Header files
- They contain prototypes/declarations of functions
- e.g standard input and output file `stdio.h`
- it contains prototypes of printf, scanf e.t.c

# Functions
`return_type name(parameter_type name, ...)
{
	Block of statements
}`

# Place holders
- Placeholder for integer(decimal number) - %d
- %i placeholder for bot -ve and +ve integers
